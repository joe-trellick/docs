You can now create\\n    a document ID that is a string, integer, boolean, array, map, or null. This\\n    means that when making `find_by_id` or `insert` calls you now need to\\n    provide a `DocumentId` object rather than a string. Similarly, when you\\n    access a document\'s ID it will now return a `DocumentId` object instead of a\\n    string.\\n  * The `start()` and `stop()` functions on the `Ditto` object have been renamed\\n    to `start_sync()` and `stop_sync()` respectively. They now also don\'t accept\\n    any arguments. If you wish to specify which transports you would like the\\n    Ditto SDK to make use of (along with any configuration that they might\\n    require) you now need to use the `set_transport_config` function on the\\n    `Ditto` object, and pass to that a transport config object.
